# playlist-project

When I found myself manually searching for albums on Spotify, I began to wonder if there was a way that I could more efficiently interface with my spotify account utilizing Python and Spotify's API. 

Upon frequently referencing webpages cointaining lists of albums, it occured to me that I could web scrape the desired artist/album names, and then use Spotify's API to add them to a playlist, or even my user library.

The notebook contained in this repository is my journey to discovering how to succesfully execute this with a bit of help from Spotipy.
